Computer Science is often learned through books and lectures — but true understanding comes from solving problems yourself. The good news is that many of these problems have been solved countless times, in different languages and with various approaches.

Here, I share my own implementations. They may start with simple solutions, but they’re enough to reveal how things actually work under the hood.
