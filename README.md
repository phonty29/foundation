# Turn fundamental concepts and ideas behind Computer Science into real code

Computer Science is mostly taught by reading books and watching lectures. But the real way to understand them deeply is to solve the problems. 
Good news, they are solved multiple times by many people on different programming langugages and different ways, so you can inspect them too. 
Here is my implementations of these problems. Of course, it will contain basic solutions, but it will be enough to understand how real things work.
